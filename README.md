# Genki Health Insurance: The Nomad-Proof Coverage That Actually Works When Things Go Wrong

---

So here's the thing about health insurance for digital nomads — nobody actually wants to think about it. You're planning your next move between Lisbon and Chiang Mai, maybe eyeing a stint in Medellín, and the last thing on your mind is "gee, I wonder what happens if I eat something sketchy and end up in a clinic at 2 AM."

But you know what? That moment *does* come. For most nomads, it's not dramatic — it's a scooter scrape in Thailand, a nasty bout of dengue in Bali, a broken wrist after a surfing session in South Africa. And when it does happen, you really, *really* wish you'd sorted this out before you left.

That's where Genki comes in. And after digging through hundreds of reviews, real user experiences, and the actual fine print, here's the honest picture.

## What Is Genki, Actually?

Genki — the name comes from a Japanese word meaning "healthy, energetic, full of spirit" — is a health insurance provider built specifically for digital nomads, long-term travelers, and expats. Launched in 2018, it's an international health insurance provider built specifically for digital nomads, expats, and remote workers, offering coverage that's both flexible and easy to manage for people from any country, traveling to any country.

It's not some random startup flying under the radar, either. Genki is backed by Allianz and Barmenia, which are established names in the insurance world and ensure reliable coverage. Behind the scenes, DR-WALTER handles insurance and claims processing, and Squarelife serves as their actual insurer — these are big names in the insurance industry with a history of over 100 years for some of those names.

The numbers tell a decent story too. According to their website, Genki has insured over 60,000+ nomads from more than 196 countries. On Trustpilot, Genki holds a 4.0 out of 5 rating with 789 reviews.

## The Two Plans That Actually Matter

Genki keeps things relatively simple. Genki now offers two main digital nomad insurance options: Genki Traveler — travel health insurance for the short-term — and Genki Native — international health insurance for the long-term.

### 🎒 Genki Traveler — For the "I'm Just Going for a While" Crowd

This is the budget-friendly entry point. Genki Traveler is a travel health insurance plan for anyone aged 0–69 from any country, with coverage for up to 12 months. It's designed more for budget-conscious backpackers and short-term travelers, but still goes beyond the basics.

What does "beyond the basics" look like? EUR 1,000,000 in coverage — among the highest limits in a travel plan — worldwide coverage including the USA and Canada, sports coverage including skiing, diving, cycling, and climbing, direct billing in case of hospitalization, and no deductible for inpatient treatment.

It covers medical emergencies, accidents, and sudden illnesses worldwide, including hospital stays, outpatient treatments, and prescriptions. Subscription-based, so you can cancel anytime.

One thing worth knowing: Genki Traveler cannot be extended beyond 1 year. If you develop a chronic condition during that year, it may be excluded from a new Traveler policy — which is why long-term nomads might seriously consider Genki Native.

### 🌏 Genki Native — For the "I Live Here Now" Crowd

If you're not just passing through — if you're actually *living* abroad for a while — Native is the serious play. It comes in two flavors: **Basic** and **Premium**.

Genki Native international health insurance is a comprehensive insurance for digital nomads and expats who spend six months or more abroad during the year.

**Native Basic** covers the medical essentials beyond emergencies — chronic conditions like cancer, diabetes, and Crohn's, inpatient and outpatient treatment, choice of doctor and hospital, and upfront payment to the medical provider for inpatient stays.

**Native Premium** is where it gets properly comprehensive. It includes everything in Native Basic, plus no limit on maximum payout, private hospital room, home nursing, preventative care, vaccines, alternative medicine, dental cleaning, vision care, mental healthcare, and maternity care. With the Genki Native Premium plan, you are entitled to your full benefits with no limit to how long you can stay in your home country.

## How Much Does It Actually Cost?

Prices vary mainly by age. There's no geographic pricing — your coverage works the same whether you're in Portugal or Peru. There is no discount for paying a year in advance, as regulations in Europe, where they're based, do not allow them to charge different people different prices for the same product.

Here's the breakdown as of early 2026:

### Genki Traveler — Monthly Pricing by Age

| Age Group | Monthly Cost (USD) | Coverage Limit | Duration |  Get Started |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## What Real People Are Saying

Trustpilot reviews are a mixed but mostly positive bag — and the honest ones are actually pretty useful for understanding what Genki does well and where to watch out.

One reviewer from December 2025 shared: "Setup a basic insurance for myself and my wife, and got a severe food poisoning in Indonesia right a month after getting Genki insurance. Got treated, filled claim — got payout in 2 working days."

Another wrote about a bicycle accident in Thailand: "Both shoulders were badly injured. Genki came through. Paid all my bills including MRIs on both shoulders."

A couple who used it for a full year world trip reported: "We had several claims, all in different countries — Argentina, Colombia, Italy — paid out of pocket and promptly reimbursed."

On the flip side, some users have flagged slower reimbursements or frustration when claims get stuck in review. One reviewer noted reimbursements "took about 7 weeks to be paid, but they were all reimbursed." The pattern from negative reviews tends to involve complex or borderline cases — straightforward claims seem to move pretty quickly.

The takeaway? Many users praise Genki's customer support and fast processing times for claims, and the easy signup process and easy-to-understand terms and conditions. Keep your documents organized, submit on time, and the system works. Let things get messy, and patience is required.

## The Sports Coverage Thing (Actually Worth Mentioning)

This is one of Genki's quiet strengths. Many insurers exclude high-risk activities, but depending on the plan you choose, Genki covers a range of adventure sports like surfing, scuba diving, and skiing, ensuring nomads can pursue their passions without extra fees or add-ons.

Genki is one of the few insurers that covers most sports and adventure activities, including climbing, biking, diving, hiking, martial arts, motorcycle riding, sailing, skiing, and surfing. Some provisions apply, such as the use of proper safety equipment. Additionally, according to Genki's contract, you are covered for "all sports & activities that are not listed."

That last bit is genuinely unusual in the insurance world. Most providers give you a whitelist; Genki essentially gives you a blacklist — which is a much shorter list.

## USA & Canada: The Fine Print That Matters

This is where a lot of people get caught off guard, so let's be clear about it.

Coverage in the US and Canada is limited to 30 days only per year and just for medical emergencies. That limit applies to every policyholder across the board, even if the USA or Canada is your country of citizenship.

Genki Traveler subscribers are limited to 7 days of coverage in the U.S. and Canada, and that coverage only includes emergencies. A "full coverage" add-on eliminates that 7-day limit for an additional monthly fee.

If you're a US citizen planning to visit family back home, this matters. If you're spending most of your time in Southeast Asia or Europe, it probably doesn't affect your day-to-day peace of mind much.
